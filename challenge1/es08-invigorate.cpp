/*Exercise - Invigorate
Excessive studies lead you search on internet recipes of energetic drinks. Luckily, a guru of 
nutrition just posted on her Instagram channel @HealthyDrinker this recipe of a miracle drink:

Pour in a mixer 2 decilitres of kiwi juice, 4 decilitres of soy sauce, and 3 decilitres of 
shampoo of karitè bio. Mix vigorously and then pour half drink into a glass. Fill the glass until 
the superior deciliter. Swallow in one shot.

You run shopping the ingredients, and get ready for mixing them. You have a measuring cup with 
which you transfer the precious fluids, one by one. While transfering, you always pour a little 
bit more than necessary (but never more than 1 decilitre), and for each ingredient you then remove 
the excess.

DO NOT use subtractions, try using only rounding operators
HINT: C++ < 20 facilities for formatting floats aren't that great, sometimes printf is 
preferable


Example - given:

double kiwi = 2.4;
double soy = 4.8;
double shampoo = 3.1;
double measuring_cup = 0.0;
double mixer = 0.0;
double glass = 0.0;
Your code must print:

I pour into the measuring cup 2.4 dl of kiwi juice, then I remove excess until keeping 2 dl
I transfer into the mixer, now it contains 2.0 dl
I pour into the measuring cup 4.8 dl of soia, then I remove excess until keeping 4 dl
I transfer into the mixer, now it contains 6.0 dl
I pour into the measuring cup 3.1 dl of shampoo, then I remove excess until keeping 3 dl
I transfer into the mixer, now it contains 9.0 dl
I pour half of the mix ( 4.5 dl ) into the glass
I fill the glass until superior deciliter, now it contains: 5 dl
